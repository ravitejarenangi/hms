# Hospital Management System Development Tasks

This document outlines the step-by-step tasks required to build a comprehensive hospital management system using the WowDash template with PostgreSQL as the database. Each task is designed to be completed sequentially, with clear instructions and focus areas.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration

### Task 1: Project Initialization
```
let's begin by laying the foundation for our Hospital Management System. Your first task is Project Initialization. Please perform the following steps:

Clean the /app directory: Remove any pre-existing demo pages or boilerplate files within the /app directory to ensure a clean starting point.
Establish the core project structure: Create the basic folder organization that will house our hospital management modules. Think about logical groupings like patients, doctors, appointments, billing, etc. Please create these top-level module directories within the main project.
Configure PostgreSQL with Prisma: Set up the connection to our PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM. This involves:
Initializing Prisma within the project if it hasn't been already.
Modifying the schema.prisma file to define our PostgreSQL provider and connection string.
Manage environment variables: Create a .env file and configure the necessary environment variables, specifically including the PostgreSQL connection URL (DATABASE_URL). Ensure this file is properly set up to be read by our application.
Initialize package.json: Ensure a package.json file exists and initialize it with the essential dependencies required for Prisma and any other core functionalities we'll need at this stage (e.g., @prisma/client, @prisma/cli, dotenv). Install these initial dependencies.
Please confirm completion of each step.
