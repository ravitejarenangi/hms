# Hospital Management System Development Tasks

This document outlines the step-by-step tasks required to build a comprehensive hospital management system using the WowDash template with PostgreSQL as the database. Each task is designed to be completed sequentially, with clear instructions and focus areas.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration

### Task 1: Project Initialization
Let's begin by laying the foundation for our Hospital Management System. Your first task is Project Initialization. Please perform the following steps:

1. Clean the /app directory: Remove any pre-existing demo pages or boilerplate files within the /app directory to ensure a clean starting point.
2. Establish the core project structure: Create the basic folder organization that will house our hospital management modules. Think about logical groupings like patients, doctors, appointments, billing, etc. Please create these top-level module directories within the main project.
3. Configure PostgreSQL with Prisma: Set up the connection to our PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM. This involves:
   - Initializing Prisma within the project if it hasn't been already.
   - Modifying the schema.prisma file to define our PostgreSQL provider and connection string.
4. Manage environment variables: Create a .env file and configure the necessary environment variables, specifically including the PostgreSQL connection URL (DATABASE_URL). Ensure this file is properly set up to be read by our application.
5. Initialize package.json: Ensure a package.json file exists and initialize it with the essential dependencies required for Prisma and any other core functionalities we'll need at this stage (e.g., @prisma/client, @prisma/cli, dotenv). Install these initial dependencies.

Please confirm completion of each step.

### Task 4: Dashboard Implementation
Create role-specific dashboards for each user type with appropriate metrics, charts, and quick access features using components from `@/components`.

1. Implement superadmin dashboard with hospital-wide metrics with backend API integration connect both frontend and backend, if you want to change database schema, please update it in `@/models`.

   **Backend**: Implement using Next.js API routes with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates. Create API routes in `/pages/api/dashboard/` for each metric (e.g., `/pages/api/dashboard/admission-discharge-rate-sse.js`). Each route should:
   - Establish an SSE connection (set appropriate headers).
   - Query the database (using Prisma) for the relevant data.
   - Send data as SSE events.
   - Handle client disconnection.

   **Frontend**: Create React components in `components/dashboard/` (e.g., `components/dashboard/AdmissionDischargeRateChart.js`) to:
   - Connect to the corresponding SSE endpoint using EventSource.
   - Update the chart data using useState on receiving SSE events.
